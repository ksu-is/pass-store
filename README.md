Description: pass-store generates a random password based on numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters along with symbols. It then writes this to a text file and compares newly generated passwords to previous passwords. If the password is found to have already been used it will prompt the user to either create a new password or acknowledge that they want to use the same password as previously ceated.
